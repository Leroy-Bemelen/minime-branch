						Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit Ethan! They're inside
						you building a monument to compromise! Fuck them, fuck those people, fuck
						this whole thing Ethan. Hello Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?
						Rick, is this a Saw thing? Are you seriously Sawing the Vindicators? Then
						it's time to get your beak wet tonight playa!

						Yo! What up my glip glops! Aw, why can't couples that start out cheating
						ever end up happy? It's been six hours. Dreams move one... one-hundredth
						the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So y'know,
						every day here is like a minute. It's like Inception, Morty, so if it's
						confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie. Do you know
						how many characters there are in the Simpsons Morty? There's like a-a
						billion characters, M-Morty. There was an episode where Former President
						BUSH was their neighbor!
